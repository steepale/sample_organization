# Tissue samples were collected in the Summer of 2014
# Sample collection data was recorded on necropsy note cards, PDFs of each card can be found in
# ./data/necropsy_cards
# Tissue sampling, organization, storage, and testing were recorded on excel files. These files are adequate
# but I would like to reorganize the data into tab delimited test files for organization purposes and data parsing
# Location of excel file: ./data/Tumor_Sampling_12_02_16.xlsx

#Band No.	Pen	Death Date	D/K	Gender	Tumors?	Control (0)	DNA	RNA	Control	DNA	RNA	Lesion	DNA	RNA	Cyto	Homogeneity

# Create a tab seperated sample of tissue collection
